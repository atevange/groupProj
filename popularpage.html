  <p> <font size="5"> When you think of Phoenix, a Japanese garden isn’t the first thing that comes to mind.
  But the city has one and its so well hidden that many longtime Phoenix residents don’t know of its existence.
  The Japanese Friendship Garden of Phoenix is an authentic 3.5 acre Japanese Stroll Garden near downtown Phoenix
  with tea garden and tea house. This tranquil and beautiful setting features more than 1,500 tons of hand-picked rock,
  stone footbridges, lanterns and more than 50 varieties of plants. As you stroll the path, you will enjoy flowing streams,
  a 12-foot waterfall, and a Koi pond with over 300 colorful fish. The garden closes annually during the summer - please check
  their website for more information. </font></p>

  <p> <font size="5"> Boasting 50 miles of trails through 16,000 acres of the Sonoran Desert, this municipal park is
  perfectly suited for outdoor adventure just minutes from the city. The skyline views and Sonoran Desert flora aren't
  the park's only perks. Keep a lookout for ancient petroglyphs carved into the rocks. If you'd rather drive than hike,
  bike or hoof it up the trails, hop on the 5.5-mile Summit Road up to Dobbins Lookout, the highest accessible point
  in the preserve. This hike has one of the most beautiful views in Phoenix. </font></p>
